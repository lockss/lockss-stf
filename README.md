       Running The LOCKSS Stochastic Testing Framework
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Overview

This directory provides a framework for running functional tests on the
LOCKSS system.  The tests are invoked using the 'testsuite.py' script and
passing it the name of a test suite to run.  They can be run without any
customization, but some settings can be tweaked through the configuration
file described below.

For each test being run, a new directory is created under the working
directory to hold the daemon config files, log files, and caches.  The
structure is basically:

    <workingDir>/testcase-<n>/daemon-<port>/...
                             /daemon-<port + 1>/...
                             /daemon-<port + 2>/...
                             ...

Where <n> is the number of the test being run.  If, for example, you run a
testsuite with five tests, this will create testcase-1 through testcase-5,
one for each test.

Each testcase directory contains a pair of auto-generated config files,
'lockss.txt' and 'lockss.opt' (see the next section for details about how to
override any daemon config param using lockss.opt) It also contains daemon
directories, one for each daemon being started.  Each daemon directory has
the following structure:

    daemon-<port>/test.out
                 /dpid
                 /local.txt

The daemon log file is 'test.out', and the PID of the daemon is 'dpid'.
'local.txt' is an auto-generated config file.

After each test is run, the daemons are stopped and the log file is examined
for thread deadlocks.  If no errors have occured while running the suite,
all the daemon directories are deleted (this can be overridden with the
deleteAfterSuccess parameter -- see below).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Configuration

Typically, no configuration is necessary, the default values are safe.
However, certain parameters can be overridden, either by editing the config
file "testsuite.props", located in this directory.  (Developers working with
the live source repository may prefer to make local changes in the file
"testsuite.opt", which is not under source control, to avoiding accidentally
sharing with all users changes that were meant to be local.)

    Parameter           Default     Meaning
    ------------------  ----------  ----------------------------------------

    daemonCount         4           The number of daemons to start.

    daemonLogLevel      debug       The logging level at which to run the
                                    LOCKSS daemons.

    scriptLogLevel      info        The logging level at which to run the
                                    test script -- this really does not need
                                    to be higher than info.

    projectDir          (none)      The path to the top level of a
                                    lockss-daemon project.  Normally the
                                    script will simply look up the path
                                    until it finds build.xml, and then
                                    assume that is the projectDir.

    workDir             ./          The top-level directory in which to
                                    build daemon directories and run the
                                    tests.

    startUiPort         8041        The start of the range of ports to use
                                    for the daemon UI.  Ports numbered
                                    'startUiPort' to 'startUiPort +
                                    (numDaemons - 1)' will be used.

    startV3Port         8081        The start of the range of ports to use
                                    for V3 LCAP.  Ports numbered
                                    'startV3Port' to 'startV3Port +
                                    (numDaemons - 1)' will be used.

    timeout             28000       The maximum time to wait for an event
                                    before timing out.  Default is eight
                                    hours, which is usually enough for even
                                    a large test.

    deleteAfterSuccess  False       Set to 'True' if you want the scripts to
                                    clean up their working directory after a
                                    successful run in which no errors
                                    occured.  (In all cases, if errors occur
                                    during the test, the daemon directories
                                    will be left intact so the logs can be
                                    reviewed)

    delayShutdown       False       If set to 'True', when the testcase ends
                                    (whether with success or failure) you
                                    will be prompted to continue, and the
                                    daemons will be left running until the
                                    'Enter' key is pressed.  This should
                                    only be set to 'True' if you will be
                                    interactively monitoring the test.

    hostname            localhost   The hostname to use when talking to the
                                    servlet UI.

    username            lockss-u    The username to use when talking to the
                                    servlet UI.

    password            lockss-p    The password to use when talking to the
                                    servlet UI.

You can also add arbitrary LOCKSS daemon config parameters to this file.
Any parameter name starting with the string 'org.lockss.' will be written
into the per-testcase 'lockss.opt' config file for you.  This config file is
loaded last by the daemon, so it will override any other values previously
set.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Invocation

The tests can be invoked with the command:

    % python testsuite.py <testsuite>

Where <testsuite> is one of the following:

    tinyUiTests     Run the tiny UI tests.

    simpleV3Tests   Run only the simple damage, simple delete, and simple
                    extra file tests.

    randomV3Tests   Run the randomized stress tests.

    v3Tests         Run both simpleV3Tests and randomV3Tests.

    postTagTests    Run the release-candidate tests (all tests which
                    require less than a gigabyte of disk space.

'simpleV3Tests' currently runs tests on very small simulated AU's.  They
damage, delete, or create a node on one of the daemons and wait for repair.

'randomV3Tests' is a set of three tests that create a randomly sized AU of
depth between 0 and 2, branch factor between 0 and 2, and number of files
per branch of between 3 and 20.  The first test damages a random number of
files (between 1 and 5).  The second test deletes a random number of files.
The third test creates a random number of extra nodes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Adding test cases

For a quick introduction to Pyunit, see:
    http://pyunit.sourceforge.net/pyunit.html

The general method for adding tests to 'testsuite.py' is as follows:

a. Create the test case class.  It should have a unique name, extend
   LockssTestCase, and override the 'runTest' method.  The method doc for
   the runTest method should be a one-line summary of what the test does --
   this will be printed to the script log when the test is run.  For
   example:

    class MyNiftyTestCase(LockssTestCase):

        def runTest(self):
           """One-line test description"""
           ...

b. At the end of the file, create a function that returns a
   unittest.TestSuite() containing your test case(s).  The name of the test
   suite is invoked as a command-line argument to the script, so it should
   be somewhat descriptive.  For example,

    def niftyTests():
        suite = unittest.TestSuite()
        suite.addTest(MyNiftyTestCase())
        suite.addTest(MyOtherNiftyTestCase())
        return suite

c. You can now run this test suite with the command:

    % python testsuite.py niftyTests

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Cleanup

If the tests fail, or if deleteAfterSuccess is set to 'False', the daemon
directories will not be deleted.  A very simple cleanup script is included.
Just invoke it with:

    % ./clean.sh


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Demos

There are three "test cases" that are actually demos created for the TRAC audit
of the CLOCKSS Archive. They show the basic functionality of the LOCKSS Polling
and Repair Protocol, which is described here:

http://documents.clockss.org/index.php/LOCKSS:_Polling_and_Repair_Protocol

Each demo creates a network of 5 LOCKSS daemons configured to preserve one
AU of simulated content:

AuditDemo1
	One of the daemons calls a poll, and the other 4 vote in it. Their
	content is all identical, so there is 100% agreement in this poll.

AuditDemo2
	One of the daemons calls a poll, but before it does one file in its
	simulated content is damaged. The other 4 vote, and they all
	disagree with the poller, who requests a repair from one of the
	other 4. Once the repair is received, the poller re-tallies the
	poll and now finds 100% agreement.

AuditDemo3
	In AuditDemo2 the simulated content was open access, so there was
	no restriction on the voter sending a repair to the poller. The
	common case is that the content is not open access, in which case
	the voter has to remember agreeing with the poller in the past
	about the AU being repaired. In this demo the daemons achieve
	agreement on the non-open access content before damage occurs at
	the poller.  Then when the poller calls a poll, detects the
	damage and requests a repair, the voter remembers the prior
	agreement and sends a repair.

As checked out from CVS, the three demos work correctly. However, they are
more informative if they are run as follows:

	cp testsuite.opt.demo testsuite.opt
	python testsuite.py AuditDemo1
	./clean.sh
	python testsuite.py AuditDemo2
	./clean.sh
	python testsuite.py AuditDemo3
	./clean.sh
	rm testsuite.opt

The testsuite.opt file configures the demos as follows:
- The logs are not automatically deleted after the demo but remain in the
  location testsuite-1/daemon-804[12345]/test.out until ./clean.sh is
  executed.
- The daemon log levels are adjusted to provide full logging of the
  polling and voting processes.
- The daemons are not shut down until the user presses ENTER. This allows
  access with user lockss-u and password lockss-p to the UI of the poller
  at:

  http://localhost:8041/

  and one of the voters at:

  http://localhost:8042/
